# checkly auth

Manage Checkly CLI authentication.

## Quick start

```bash
# Interactive login (browser-based)
npx checkly login

# Check authentication status
npx checkly whoami

# Switch to a known account in multi-account setups
npx checkly switch --account-id <account-id>

# Log out of saved local-session credentials
npx checkly logout

# Manual configuration (for CI/CD)
export CHECKLY_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID="your-account-id"
```

## Authentication methods

Checkly accepts two current API-key types in addition to browser login credentials:

- **User API key (`cu_...`)**: tied to one user and inherits that user's roles and account memberships. Create it under **User Settings → API Keys**.
- **Service API key (`sv_...`)**: tied to one account with a role assigned to the key. Create it under **Account Settings → API Keys**; service keys require an Enterprise plan.

Deprecated account API keys and old `sk_...` service-key formats are legacy credentials. Do not use them for organization usage reporting. Never print a key while identifying its type.

### Interactive login (recommended for local development)

```bash
npx checkly login
```

Uses a device code: approve the displayed URL and short code in any browser/device. This works over SSH, in containers and remote agent sessions. URL, code and waiting notes go to stderr; result/agent JSON goes to stdout.

```bash
# Headless interactive host
npx checkly login --no-browser
# Choose a default account explicitly; also works with an existing login
npx checkly login --account-id <account-id>
# Agent: after relaying the code from an earlier login invocation
npx checkly login --wait
```

`CHECKLY_NO_BROWSER=1` also suppresses browser launch. An agent first receives an `action_required` JSON line with `reason: "login_required"`, the verification URL and code. Relay those to the user, then run `login --wait` to collect approval without asking the user to announce completion. If several accounts are available, relay the returned account choices and select the intended default with `--account-id`; do not choose arbitrarily. Login failure or cancelling account selection exits 1.

Commands that need authentication can initiate device login when a person is at a terminal. CI and non-terminal scripts instead fail with credential-variable guidance. Prompts require stdin and stderr to be terminals, so piping stdout is supported but redirecting stderr suppresses prompts. Non-interactive logout clears saved credentials without an unanswerable confirmation prompt.

Login manages platform-specific local configuration: `auth.json` contains authentication state (including a pending device authorization), and `config.json` contains the saved default account. Prefer login/logout/switch to manually editing these files; never print their credential contents.

### Environment variables (recommended for CI/CD)

```bash
export CHECKLY_API_KEY="cu_abc123..."
export CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID="12345"

# Test authentication
npx checkly whoami
```

**Getting your credentials:**
1. For a personal user key, open [User Settings → API Keys](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/user/api-keys) and create a `cu_...` key.
2. For a stable account-scoped automation identity on Enterprise, open [Account Settings → API Keys](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/account/api-keys), create a service key, and assign the least required role; current service keys start with `sv_...`.
3. Copy the target Account ID from the URL or **Account Settings → General**.

`npx checkly login` is the preferred local-development path and creates an accepted user-scoped browser session without requiring you to copy a key into the shell.

Environment variables take precedence over saved `npx checkly login` credentials. `npx checkly whoami` tells you when the active account is resolved from `CHECKLY_API_KEY` / `CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID`, and `npx checkly logout` warns if those env vars still keep you authenticated after local session cleanup.

## Workflows

### First-time setup

1. **Sign up for Checkly account** (if needed):
   ```bash
   # Opens signup page
   npx checkly login
   ```

2. **Authenticate CLI**:
   ```bash
   npx checkly login
   ```

3. **Verify authentication**:
   ```bash
   npx checkly whoami
   ```

   Inspect the effective account and its source; use `--output json` for scripts.

4. **Initialize project**:
   ```bash
   npm create checkly@latest
   ```

### Switching accounts

If you have multiple Checkly accounts:

1. **List or verify the current account**:
   ```bash
   npx checkly whoami
   ```

2. **Switch directly when you know the target account ID**:
   ```bash
   npx checkly switch --account-id <account-id>
   ```

3. **If you need a fresh browser login, clear saved local-session credentials first**:
   ```bash
   npx checkly logout --force
   npx checkly login
   ```

4. **Verify the selected account**:
   ```bash
   npx checkly whoami
   ```

`CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID` selects an account per command without changing the saved default, including with a stored login. `login` is allowed while this override is set; `login`, `switch` and `whoami` explain when it overrides the default. `login --account-id` or `switch --account-id` changes the default, but cannot override a still-set environment selection.

```bash
CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID=<account-id> npx checkly whoami --output json
```

`whoami` reports the default account, other accounts, effective account and its source. `switch` without a terminal returns account choices to agents, or an error listing accounts to scripts, rather than displaying a menu. Inaccessible-account errors name the chosen account/source and explain how to change it; stored-login overrides can list accessible accounts.

### CI/CD authentication

For automated pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.):

1. **Create a current API key in Checkly UI**:
   - Prefer an account-scoped service API key (`sv_...`) for shared/non-interactive automation when the Enterprise feature is available.
   - Otherwise create a dedicated user API key (`cu_...`) under the automation user's **User Settings → API Keys**; it remains tied to that user's membership.
   - Assign the least role needed by the pipeline: read-only inspection does not need deploy permissions, while deployment needs write access.

2. **Add secrets to CI/CD platform**:
   - `CHECKLY_API_KEY`: Your API key
   - `CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your account ID

3. **Use in pipeline**:
   ```yaml
   # GitHub Actions example
   - name: Test checks
     env:
       CHECKLY_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CHECKLY_API_KEY }}
       CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID: ${{ secrets.CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID }}
     run: npx checkly test
   
   - name: Deploy checks
     env:
       CHECKLY_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CHECKLY_API_KEY }}
       CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID: ${{ secrets.CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID }}
     run: npx checkly deploy --force
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### "Could not find Checkly credentials"

**Cause**: No authentication configured

**Solution**:
```bash
# Option 1: Interactive login
npx checkly login

# Option 2: Set environment variables
export CHECKLY_API_KEY="your-key"
export CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID="your-account-id"
```

### `whoami` still shows an account after logout

**Cause**: `CHECKLY_API_KEY` or `CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID` are still set in the shell or loaded from a project `.env`. `npx checkly logout` can clear saved local-session credentials but cannot remove environment variables.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Inspect environment-backed credentials without printing secret values
env | grep '^CHECKLY_.*=' | sed 's/=.*$/=<set>/'

# Unset for the current shell if you want to use browser login credentials instead
unset CHECKLY_API_KEY CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID
npx checkly whoami
```

### "401 Unauthorized"

**Possible causes**:
- API key has been deleted or revoked
- API key doesn't have required permissions
- Account ID doesn't match API key

**Solution**:
1. Verify credentials:
   ```bash
   npx checkly whoami
   ```

2. If invalid, re-authenticate:
   ```bash
   npx checkly login
   ```

3. For CI/CD, regenerate API key in Checkly UI

### "Account not found"

**Cause**: Account ID is incorrect

**Solution**:
1. Log into [app.checklyhq.com](https://app.checklyhq.com)
2. Check URL: `app.checklyhq.com/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/...`
3. Or check Account Settings → Account ID
4. Update `CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID` environment variable

### Permission errors during deploy

**Cause**: API key has read-only permissions

**Solution**:
1. Go to Account Settings → API Keys in Checkly UI
2. Create new API key with "Read/Write" permissions
3. Update your API key

## Environment variables reference

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `CHECKLY_API_KEY` | For API-key auth | Current user (`cu_...`) or service (`sv_...`) API key |
| `CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID` | With API key | Account GUID; also overrides the saved login default |
| `CHECKLY_API_URL` | No | Override the local API URL when `CHECKLY_ENV=local` (default: `http://127.0.0.1:3000`) |
| `CHECKLY_MQTT_URL` | No | Override the local events/MQTT broker when `CHECKLY_ENV=local` |
| `CHECKLY_NO_BROWSER` | No | Set to `1` to print device-login URL/code without opening a browser |

`CHECKLY_MQTT_URL` is advanced troubleshooting configuration for local or custom setups where test-session event streams come from a different broker. It is analogous to `CHECKLY_API_URL` for local endpoint overrides, not a normal hosted Checkly credential or default CI setting.

## Authentication is fixed for each invocation

`CHECKLY_API_KEY`, `CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CHECKLY_ENV`, `CHECKLY_API_URL` and `CHECKLY_MQTT_URL` are frozen once authentication succeeds. Changing them from check/config code or a later dotenv load warns and cannot redirect that run. Choose credentials/endpoints before starting the process: in the shell, command prefix or `.env` of the invocation directory. Keep application test variables separate from CLI identity.


## Security best practices

### Local development

- ✅ Use `npx checkly login` (credentials stored securely)
- ✅ Add config file to `.gitignore` (if using manual config)
- ❌ Don't commit API keys to version control

### CI/CD pipelines

- ✅ Store credentials as encrypted secrets
- ✅ Use API keys with minimal required permissions
- ✅ Rotate API keys regularly
- ❌ Don't log API keys in pipeline output

### API key management

- ✅ Create separate API keys for different purposes (CI/CD, local dev)
- ✅ Name keys descriptively ("GitHub Actions Deploy", "John's Laptop")
- ✅ Revoke unused or compromised keys immediately
- ❌ Don't share API keys between team members

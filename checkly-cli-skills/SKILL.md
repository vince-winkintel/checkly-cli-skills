# Checkly CLI Skills

Comprehensive Checkly CLI command reference and Monitoring as Code (MaC) workflows.

## Choose CLI or MCP first

This skill pack drives `npx checkly` in a shell. Use the CLI for authoring, testing, importing, and deploying Monitoring as Code. Checkly MCP covers only a subset of live-account work: check status/results, test sessions, root-cause analysis, triggering deployed checks, and incidents.

Before the first command that talks to the Checkly API:

1. With shell access, run `npx checkly whoami` once.
   - If it succeeds, continue with the CLI, even when Checkly MCP tools are also connected.
   - If authentication fails, do not work around it for authoring, testing, imports, or deploys; authenticate with `npx checkly login` or `CHECKLY_API_KEY` plus `CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID`.
   - For supported live-account work only, an authenticated Checkly MCP connection may be used as a fallback. Call its `whoami` tool first and name the account being used.
2. Without shell access, use connected Checkly MCP tools only for their supported live-account operations. The MCP server cannot replace the CLI for Monitoring as Code.

Never mix CLI and MCP evidence without confirming that both sessions use the same account ID. A fallback write still requires the same explicit review/confirmation as the corresponding CLI action.

Run `npx checkly skills` before choosing a live CLI action. It loads the current action list locally and does not require Checkly authentication.

## Quick start

```bash
# Create new Checkly project
npm create checkly@latest

# Test checks locally
npx checkly test

# Deploy to Checkly cloud
npx checkly deploy

# Inspect Checkly's bundled CLI agent references when needed
npx checkly skills
```

## What is Monitoring as Code?

The Checkly CLI provides a TypeScript/JavaScript-native workflow for coding, testing, and deploying synthetic monitoring at scale. Define your monitoring checks as code, test them locally, version control them with Git, and deploy through CI/CD pipelines.

**Key benefits:**
- **Codeable** - Define checks in TypeScript/JavaScript
- **Testable** - Run checks locally before deployment
- **Reviewable** - Code review your monitoring in PRs
- **Native Playwright** - Use standard @playwright/test specs
- **CI/CD Native** - Integrate with your deployment pipeline

## Skill organization

This skill routes to specialized sub-skills by Checkly domain:

**Getting Started:**
- `checkly-auth` - Authentication setup and login
- `checkly-config` - Configuration files (checkly.config.ts) and project structure
- `checkly-members` - Account member and pending-invite listing, role updates, and removals

**Core Workflows:**
- `checkly-test` - Local testing workflow with npx checkly test
- `checkly-deploy` - Deployment to Checkly cloud
- `checkly-import` - Import existing checks from Checkly to code

**Check Types:**
- `checkly-checks` - API checks, browser checks, multi-step checks
- `checkly-monitors` - Heartbeat, TCP, DNS, URL, gRPC, SSL, and traceroute monitors
- `checkly-groups` - Check groups for organization and shared config

**Advanced:**
- `checkly-constructs` - Constructs system and resource management
- `checkly-playwright` - Playwright test suites and configuration
- `checkly-advanced` - Retry strategies, reporters, environment variables, bundling

**Operations:**
- `checkly-members` - Audit and manage Checkly account access with `npx checkly members`
- `checkly-test` - Also covers `npx checkly test-sessions` for recorded test-session drilldown and RCA context
- `checkly-checks` - Inspect, run, and delete deployed checks with `npx checkly checks`; confirm live-run targets before `checks run`, and use `checks delete --dry-run` before destructive deletes
- `checkly-assets` - List/download result assets such as logs, traces, videos, screenshots, pcap, reports, and files for failure investigation

## When to use Checkly CLI vs Web UI

**Use Checkly CLI when:**
- Defining monitoring as part of your codebase
- Automating check creation/updates in CI/CD
- Testing checks locally during development
- Version controlling monitoring configuration
- Managing multiple checks efficiently
- Integrating monitoring with application deployments

**Use Web UI when:**
- Exploring Checkly for the first time
- Viewing dashboards and historical results
- Analyzing check failures and incidents
- Managing account-level settings
- Configuring alert channels (email, Slack App, PagerDuty)
- Setting up private locations

## Common workflows

### New project setup

```bash
# Initialize project
npm create checkly@latest
cd my-checkly-project

# Authenticate
npx checkly login

# Test locally
npx checkly test

# Deploy to cloud
npx checkly deploy
```

### Daily development

```bash
# Create new API check
cat > __checks__/api-status.check.ts <<'EOF'
import { ApiCheck, AssertionBuilder } from 'checkly/constructs'

new ApiCheck('api-status-check', {
  name: 'API Status Check',
  request: {
    url: 'https://api.example.com/status',
    method: 'GET',
    assertions: [
      AssertionBuilder.statusCode().equals(200),
      AssertionBuilder.responseTime().lessThan(500),
    ],
  },
})
EOF

# Test locally
npx checkly test

# Deploy when ready
npx checkly deploy
```

### Browser check with Playwright

```bash
# Create browser check
cat > __checks__/homepage.spec.ts <<'EOF'
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'

test('homepage loads', async ({ page }) => {
  const response = await page.goto('https://example.com')
  expect(response?.status()).toBeLessThan(400)
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Example/)
  await page.screenshot({ path: 'homepage.jpg' })
})
EOF

# Test with Playwright locally (faster)
npx playwright test __checks__/homepage.spec.ts

# Test via Checkly runtime
npx checkly test __checks__/homepage.spec.ts

# Deploy
npx checkly deploy
```

### Import existing checks

```bash
# Preview generated code without creating a plan
npx checkly import --preview

# Create the plan and generated code
npx checkly import plan

# Review generated code
git diff

# Apply one reviewed plan, but keep it pending during PR review
npx checkly import apply --plan-id <plan-id> --no-commit

# After the generated code is merged into the deployment branch, preview commit
npx checkly import commit --plan-id <plan-id> --dry-run
```

Do not deploy generated import code before applying its plan: that can create duplicate resources. Keep the applied plan pending until the generated code is durable, then commit it through the confirmation protocol in `checkly-import`.

### Agent-mode confirmation protocol

Write commands such as `deploy`, `destroy`, `import commit`, and `import cancel` return exit code 2 with `status: "confirmation_required"` in agent mode. Present the returned `changes` to the user, then run the returned `confirmCommand` verbatim only after explicit approval. Do not append `--force` yourself, remove flags that appear in the returned command, or assume parser-default flags are user intent.

### Inspect deployed check failures

```bash
# List failing checks
npx checkly checks list --status failing

# Inspect a deployed check and recent runs
npx checkly checks get <check-id>
npx checkly checks get <check-id> --output json

# Drill into an error group or specific result
npx checkly checks get <check-id> --error-group <error-group-id>
npx checkly checks get <check-id> --result <result-id>
```

When investigating a deployed failure, look for `errorGroups`, `rootCause`, or `RCA` fields in the output. If Checkly already surfaced Rocky AI root-cause analysis, reuse that context before suggesting additional debugging steps.

To trigger deployed checks rather than test local project definitions, route to `checkly-checks` for `npx checkly checks run`. This creates live check sessions using deployed locations and alerting rules, so confirm the intended check IDs or tags before running it; omitting selectors targets all deployed checks.

For alerting questions, use read-only JSON/API evidence before table output:

```bash
npx checkly checks get <check-id> --output json
npx checkly api /v1/checks/<check-id>
npx checkly alert-channels list --output json --limit 100
```

Only fetch alert-channel details for channel IDs referenced by the selected check or matching group. If the check has a `groupId`, inspect groups once with `npx checkly api /v1/check-groups` and locate the matching group. Do not probe guessed account/global alerting endpoints; if output only shows `useGlobalAlertSettings: true`, say global alert settings are selected but their policy details were not available in the inspected CLI/API output.

## Decision Trees

### "What type of check should I create?"

```
What are you monitoring?
├─ REST API / HTTP endpoint
│  ├─ Simple availability → API Check (request + status assertion)
│  ├─ Complex validation → API Check (request + multiple assertions + scripts)
│  └─ Just uptime/ping → URL Monitor (simpler, faster)
│
├─ Web application / User flow
│  ├─ Single page → Browser Check (one .spec.ts file)
│  ├─ Multiple steps → Browser Check or Multi-Step Check
│  └─ Full test suite → Playwright Check Suite (playwright.config.ts)
│
└─ Service health / Infrastructure
   ├─ Periodic heartbeat → Heartbeat Monitor
   ├─ TCP port → TCP Monitor
   ├─ DNS record → DNS Monitor
   ├─ Simple HTTP → URL Monitor
   ├─ gRPC method / health service → gRPC Monitor
   ├─ Certificate / TLS posture → SSL Monitor
   └─ Network path / packet loss → Traceroute Monitor
```

**Quick reference:**
- **API Check**: HTTP requests with assertions (status, headers, body, response time)
- **Browser Check**: Single Playwright spec file for web testing
- **Multi-Step Check**: Complex browser workflows (legacy, use Browser Check instead)
- **Playwright Check Suite**: Multiple Playwright tests with projects/parallelization
- **Monitors**: Simple health checks without code execution

### "Test locally or deploy?"

```
What stage are you at?
├─ Developing new check
│  ├─ Browser check → npx playwright test (fastest iteration)
│  └─ API check → npx checkly test (includes assertions)
│
├─ Ready to validate
│  └─ npx checkly test (runs in Checkly runtime, catches issues)
│
└─ Ready for production
   └─ npx checkly deploy (schedule checks to run continuously)
```

**Testing hierarchy:**
1. `npx playwright test` - Fastest, local Playwright execution (browser checks only)
2. `npx checkly test` - Validates in Checkly runtime, catches compatibility issues
3. `npx checkly deploy` - Deploys for continuous scheduled monitoring

### "File-based or construct-based checks?"

```
How do you want to define checks?
├─ Auto-discovery (convention over configuration)
│  ├─ Browser checks → *.spec.ts files matching testMatch pattern
│  ├─ Multi-step → *.check.ts files with MultiStepCheck construct
│  └─ API checks → *.check.ts files with ApiCheck construct
│
└─ Explicit definition
   ├─ Programmatic → Construct instances in .check.ts files
   └─ Full control → Playwright Check Suite with playwright.config.ts
```

**Patterns:**
- **Auto-discovery**: Configure `checks.browserChecks.testMatch` in checkly.config.ts
- **Explicit constructs**: Import from `checkly/constructs` and instantiate
- **Playwright projects**: Define multiple test suites with different configs

### "Where should configuration go?"

```
What are you configuring?
├─ Project-level (all checks)
│  └─ checkly.config.ts → defaults, locations, frequency, runtime
│
├─ Group-level (related checks)
│  └─ CheckGroup construct → shared settings for subset of checks
│
└─ Check-level (individual)
   └─ Check constructor → override defaults for specific check
```

**Configuration hierarchy** (specific overrides general):
1. Check-level properties (highest priority)
2. CheckGroup properties
3. checkly.config.ts defaults
4. Checkly account defaults (lowest priority)

## Project structure

Typical Checkly CLI project:

```
my-monitoring-project/
├── checkly.config.ts          # Project configuration
├── __checks__/                # Check definitions
│   ├── api.check.ts           # API check construct
│   ├── homepage.spec.ts       # Browser check (auto-discovered)
│   ├── login.spec.ts          # Another browser check
│   └── utils/
│       ├── alert-channels.ts  # Shared alert channel definitions
│       └── helpers.ts         # Shared helper functions
├── playwright.config.ts       # Playwright configuration (optional)
├── package.json
└── node_modules/
    └── checkly/               # CLI package with constructs
```

## Checkly bundled agent references

`npx checkly rules` is deprecated; use `npx checkly skills` instead when you need Checkly's bundled AI-agent documentation, actions, or reference snippets:

```bash
npx checkly skills
npx checkly skills configure
npx checkly skills configure api-checks
npx checkly skills install
```

This repository is an external multi-skill package for agent clients. Do not rely on the deprecated `checkly rules` command when refreshing or installing these skills.

## Installation methods

### New project (recommended)

```bash
npm create checkly@latest
```

Creates scaffolded project with:
- `checkly.config.ts` with sensible defaults
- Example checks in `__checks__/` directory
- `package.json` with checkly dependency
- `.gitignore` configured

### Existing project

```bash
# Install as dev dependency
npm install --save-dev checkly

# Create configuration file
npx checkly init
```

### Global installation (not recommended)

```bash
npm install -g checkly
checkly test
```

**Note**: Use `npx checkly` instead for project-specific CLI version.

# checkly test

Test Checkly checks locally with `npx checkly test`.

## Quick start

```bash
# Test all checks
npx checkly test

# Test specific check
npx checkly test __checks__/api.check.ts

# Test with verbose output
npx checkly test --verbose

# Test in specific location
npx checkly test --location=eu-west-1

# List recorded test sessions after CI or cloud runs
npx checkly test-sessions list --status failed --limit 10

# Drill into a failed session and a specific result/error group
npx checkly test-sessions get <session-id> --result <result-id>
npx checkly test-sessions get <session-id> --error-group <error-group-id> --full-error
```

## How it works

`npx checkly test` executes your checks in Checkly's runtime environment (same as production) without deploying persistent resources or changing recurring schedules. Perfect for:
- ✅ Pre-deployment validation
- ✅ CI/CD integration
- ✅ Local development iteration
- ✅ Debugging check failures

The CLI dispatches test sessions through Checkly's asynchronous scheduling API and watches scheduling before collecting results. Scheduling failures now fail fast with the server error instead of waiting for the per-check timeout. With `--detach`, the CLI confirms scheduling reached a terminal state before exiting, so dispatch failures still return non-zero.

## Empty selections, timeouts and early stopping

`test` exits 1 if no checks match a file filter, `--grep` or `--tags`. Use `--list` to inspect the selection (exit 0), or `--no-fail-on-no-matching` only when an empty selection is intentional. `pw-test` also exits 1 for no checks; it has no matching opt-out flag. A passing empty selection must not stand in for a test gate.

```bash
npx checkly test --list
npx checkly test --tags smoke --max-failures=2
npx checkly trigger --max-failures=2
# Only for workflows where zero matches are intentionally acceptable
npx checkly test --grep optional --no-fail-on-no-matching
```

`--max-failures=<n>` on `test` and `trigger`, or `cli.maxFailures`, stops waiting once n checks have final failures, writes reports, requests best-effort session cancellation and exits 1. The limit must be an integer of at least 1; omit the setting for no limit. A successful retry does not count as a failure. Unfinished checks report `Not finished`; JSON includes `stoppedEarly`. Some checks may still execute remotely. The flag cannot combine with `--detach`, or with `test --update-snapshots`. A configured `cli.maxFailures` is ignored for detached runs and ignored with a notice for snapshot updates.

For `test`, `trigger` and `pw-test`, `--timeout` measures run time from each check's start and restarts on retries. Scheduling delay is excluded; a check that never starts times out after the configured timeout plus 900 seconds. CLI-side timeouts mean the CLI stopped waiting, not necessarily that the remote check stopped.

Timed-out results use `result: "Timed out"` in JSON, `T` in dot output, and a timeout marker/count in list/CI/GitHub reporters; exit remains 1. Match both `Fail` and `Timed out` if parsing result strings, or use exit status. Reporters show retry counts and count recovered checks as both passed and flaky. The CLI guards against duplicate results at timeout boundaries and retries failed result-stream connections. Cancellation failure no longer crashes Ctrl+C handling; a second Ctrl+C yields shell status 130.

Stdout contains results and summaries. Progress, warnings and errors go to stderr. Default reporter is `ci` in CI and agent mode, `list` otherwise; an explicit flag/config overrides it. Set `CI=false` (or `0`, `no`, `off`) to disable CI detection even on provider hosts. Avoid pinning `reporters: ['list']` in general-purpose configs if automatic selection is desired.

## Recorded test sessions

Use `test-sessions` drilldown commands for recorded sessions after `npx checkly test`, `npx checkly trigger`, CI runs, or Playwright Reporter uploads when you need failure details, result IDs, or error-group context for RCA.

For cancelled or timed-out runs started by `checkly test`, `checkly trigger`, or `checkly pw-test`, inspect the recorded session with the existing commands below; cancellation handling is backend/runner wiring rather than a separate public `test-sessions` command or flag.

```bash
# List recent sessions
npx checkly test-sessions list

# List failed sessions from a branch as JSON
npx checkly test-sessions list --status failed --branch main --limit 20 --output json

# Filter sessions by provider or error group
npx checkly test-sessions list --provider github --error-group <error-group-id>

# Inspect a session summary and error-group IDs
npx checkly test-sessions get <session-id>

# Wait for a running session to finish before rendering
npx checkly test-sessions get <session-id> --watch

# Drill into one result or one error group
npx checkly test-sessions get <session-id> --result <result-id>
npx checkly test-sessions get <session-id> --error-group <error-group-id> --full-error
```

## Workflows

### Basic testing

```bash
# Test everything
npx checkly test

# Output:
# Parsing your project... done
# Running 3 checks in us-east-1.
# 
# __checks__/api.check.ts
#  ✔ API Status Check (234ms)
# __checks__/homepage.spec.ts  
#  ✔ Homepage Check (2.1s)
# __checks__/login.spec.ts
#  ✔ Login Flow (3.4s)
#
# 3 passed, 3 total
```

### Test specific checks

```bash
# Single file
npx checkly test __checks__/api.check.ts

# Multiple files
npx checkly test __checks__/api.check.ts __checks__/homepage.spec.ts

# Pattern matching
npx checkly test __checks__/api-*.check.ts

# By name (grep)
npx checkly test --grep="Homepage"
```

### Verbose debugging

```bash
npx checkly test --verbose

# Shows:
# - Request/response details (API checks)
# - Console logs (browser checks)
# - Screenshots (on failure)
# - Full stack traces
# - Environment variables used
```

### Testing in different locations

```bash
# Test from EU datacenter
npx checkly test --location=eu-west-1

# Test from multiple locations (requires configuration)
# Set in checkly.config.ts:
checks: {
  locations: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1'],
}
```

### CI/CD integration

```yaml
# GitHub Actions
name: Test Checks
on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v7
        with:
          node-version: '22.13.0'
      
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx checkly test
        env:
          CHECKLY_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CHECKLY_API_KEY }}
          CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID: ${{ secrets.CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID }}
```

### Test with retries

```bash
# Retry failed checks once
npx checkly test --retries=1

# Useful for flaky tests or network issues
```

### Environment variables

```bash
# Inline
API_BASE_URL=https://staging.example.com npx checkly test

# From .env file
npx checkly test --env-file=.env.test

# .env.test
API_BASE_URL=https://staging.example.com
API_KEY=test-key-123
```

## Reporters

### List reporter (default outside CI and agent mode)

```bash
npx checkly test --reporter=list

# Detailed output with timings
```

### Dot reporter

```bash
npx checkly test --reporter=dot

# Compact: . = pass, F = fail, T = timed out
```

### CI reporter

```bash
npx checkly test --reporter=ci

# Optimized for CI logs
```

### GitHub reporter

```bash
npx checkly test --reporter=github

# Generates GitHub Actions annotations
```

### JSON reporter

```bash
npx checkly test --reporter=json > results.json

# Machine-readable output
```

For failed gRPC, SSL, and traceroute monitors, terminal and JSON reporters include type-specific diagnostics when available. Inspect gRPC status/health/metadata, TLS certificate and handshake details, or traceroute hops/latency/packet loss before falling back to generic network troubleshooting.

## Testing strategies

### Local-first workflow

```bash
# 1. Write Playwright test
cat > __checks__/new-feature.spec.ts

# 2. Test locally with Playwright (fastest)
npx playwright test __checks__/new-feature.spec.ts

# 3. Validate in Checkly runtime
npx checkly test __checks__/new-feature.spec.ts

# 4. Deploy when passing
npx checkly deploy
```

### Pre-deployment validation

```bash
# Run full test suite before deploy
npx checkly test && npx checkly deploy --force
```

### Debugging failures

```bash
# 1. Run with verbose output
npx checkly test __checks__/failing.spec.ts --verbose

# 2. Check for common issues:
#    - API endpoint changed?
#    - Auth token expired?
#    - Selector changed (browser checks)?
#    - Environment variable missing?

# 3. Test locally first (browser checks)
npx playwright test __checks__/failing.spec.ts --headed

# 4. Compare environments
#    - Local vs Checkly runtime
#    - Check Node.js version
#    - Check npm package versions
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No checks found to test"

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check configuration
npx checkly validate

# Verify files exist
ls -la __checks__/

# Check checkMatch pattern in checkly.config.ts
```

### "Check failed: Connection timeout"

**Causes**:
- Endpoint not accessible from Checkly locations
- Firewall blocking Checkly IPs
- Endpoint genuinely down

**Solution**:
```bash
# Test from different location
npx checkly test --location=eu-west-1

# For private endpoints, use private locations
```

### "Module not found" errors

**Cause**: npm package not available in Checkly runtime

**Solution**:
```bash
# Validate dependencies
npx checkly test --verify-runtime-dependencies

# See supported packages:
# https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/runtimes/
```

### Flaky tests

**Solution**:
```bash
# Enable retries
npx checkly test --retries=2

# Or configure in checkly.config.ts:
checks: {
  retryStrategy: RetryStrategyBuilder.fixedStrategy({
    maxRetries: 2,
    baseBackoffSeconds: 60,
  }),
}
```

## Testing vs Deploying

| Command | Purpose | Scheduled | Billed |
|---------|---------|-----------|--------|
| `npx checkly test` | Validation | ❌ No | ❌ No* |
| `npx checkly deploy` | Production monitoring | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

*Test runs count towards your account's test run limit but are not billed separately.
